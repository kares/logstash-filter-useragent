=== Useragent filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Parse user agent strings into structured data based on BrowserScope data

UserAgent filter, adds information about user agent like name, version, operating
system, and device.

Logstash releases ship with the regexes.yaml database made available from
ua-parser with an Apache 2.0 license. For more details on ua-parser, see
<https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-options"]
==== Useragent Filter Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-lru_cache_size>> |<<number,number>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-prefix>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-regexes>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-source>> |<<string,string>>|Yes
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-target>> |<<string,string>>|No
|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
filter plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility"]
===== `ecs_compatibility`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Supported values are:
** `disabled`: does not use ECS-compatible field names (fields might be set at the root of the event)
** `v1`: uses fields that are compatible with Elastic Common Schema (for example, `[user_agent][version]`)
* Default value depends on which version of Logstash is running:
** When Logstash provides a `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting, its value is used as the default
** Otherwise, the default value is `disabled`.

Controls this plugin's compatibility with the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].
The value of this setting affects the _default_ value of <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-target>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-lru_cache_size"]
===== `lru_cache_size` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `100000`

UA parsing is surprisingly expensive. This filter uses an LRU cache to take advantage of the fact that
user agents are often found adjacent to one another in log files and rarely have a random distribution.
The higher you set this the more likely an item is to be in the cache and the faster this filter will run.
However, if you set this too high you can use more memory than desired.

Experiment with different values for this option to find the best performance for your dataset.

This MUST be set to a value > 0. There is really no reason to not want this behavior, the overhead is minimal
and the speed gains are large.

It is important to note that this config value is global. That is to say all instances of the user agent filter
share the same cache. The last declared cache size will 'win'. The reason for this is that there would be no benefit
to having multiple caches for different instances at different points in the pipeline, that would just increase the
number of cache misses and waste memory.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-prefix"]
===== `prefix` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `""`

A string to prepend to all of the extracted keys

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-regexes"]
===== `regexes` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

If not specified, this will default to the `regexes.yaml` that ships
with logstash. Otherwise use the provided `regexes.yaml` file.

You can find the latest version of this here:
<https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/blob/master/regexes.yaml>

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-source"]
===== `source` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The field containing the user agent string. If this field is an
array, only the first value will be used.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-target"]
===== `target` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value depends on whether <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility>> is enabled:
    ** ECS Compatibility disabled: no default value for this setting
    ** ECS Compatibility enabled: `"user_agent"`

The name of the field to assign user agent data into.

If not specified user agent data will be stored in the root of the event.
